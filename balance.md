Power consumption of a single WH:
(i).  5 + y*(200 * 100 * 20)^x = 60*0.75
(ii). 5 + y*(200 * 10 *  20)^x = 7

Results:
y = 2.05879 x 10^-6
x = 1.30103

Power drain examples:
 5MW @empty
45MW @100 slots of ore
60MW @215 slots of ore and over
 8MW @full of intermediates

Global multiplier "p" based on how many WHs are built (n)
(n / x) ^ y = p
(iii.) (20 / x) ^ y = 0.05
(iv.)  (50 / x) ^ y = 1
(1/20 of the power cost at )
